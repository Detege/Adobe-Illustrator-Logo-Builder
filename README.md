# Adobe-Illustrator-Logo-Builder
Automation script to create all RGB and CMYK, colour and monochrome versions of a sub-product logo

This script can be run from Adobe Illustrator to add a product header to a given logo. Think adding "Prime" to the Amazon logo.
The Script will output every posible file format that could be needed for any print or digital application.

This was my first JavaScript project after completing the course from MDN web docs. It was used to generate 60+ sub-product logos, saving a lot of resources to the Marketing Design Team during the re-branding of the company.
