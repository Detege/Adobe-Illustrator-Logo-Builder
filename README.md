# Adobe-Illustrator-Logo-Builder
Automation script to create all RGB and CMYK, colour and monochrome versions of a sub-product logo

This script can be run from Adobe Illustrator to add a product header to a given logo. Think adding "Prime" to the Amazon logo.
The Script will output every posible file format that could be needed for any print or digital application.
